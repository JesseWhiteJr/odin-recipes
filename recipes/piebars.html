        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you love apple pie as much as I do, here is your apple pie fix that is easier and
            and faster than a standard pie...but just as tasty.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/3 vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup milk - low fat or whole</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>8 cups Granny smith apples, peeled, colored and cut into 1 inch chunks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step by Step Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375Â° F</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, & salt in a bowl</li>
            <li>Add oil & milk all at once, stirring with a fork. By hand, divide dough in half and shape each half into a smooth mound</li>
            <li>Roll one mound between 2 sheets of floured wax paper to about an 8" square and set aside</li>
            <li>Between 2 more sheets of wax paper, roll the other mound into a 9-inch square and transfer to the bottom of an 8x8-inch 
                ungreased or parchment paper lined square pan, pressing some crust up the sides. (or you can press the mound of dough into the pan, by hand.)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine sugar, spices, and flour or tapioca in a large bowl</li>
            <li>Add apples</li>
            <li>Place into pan and top with second crust. Patch if needed but a few openings are okay</li>
            <li>Brush with milk and sprinkle with 2 tsp. sugar. Poke about 9 holes in top crust with a sharp knife</li>
            <li>Bake about 50 minutes until top is golden. Cool. Cut into bars</li>
        </ol>
